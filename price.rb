class Price

  # This class models the pricing system
  # - allow_integer_only: bool, if true raises an exception when asking to calculate price for non-integer quantity
  # - allow_offers: bool, if true offer cannot be assigned to this price
  # - price_by_quantity: the price for a single unit
  #   note that this can be used also for units of weight as long as they are converted to the base value
  #   of each weight unit. For instance, a price of 3 euro per kg could be modeled as 0.003 euro per g
  #   this answers the requirement of the exercise
  # - special_offer: class Offer, this allows for implementation of time based special offers
